            Legrand and Scally met in Baltimore's indie rock scene and formed Beach House in 2004. They began releasing songs soon after, including "Apple Orchard," which appeared on Pitchfork's Infinite Mixtape MP3 series in August 2006. That October, Carpark released the duo's hazy self-titled debut album, which Beach House recorded in Scally's basement on a four-track recorder. Beach House earned favorable reviews as well as comparisons to Nico and Mazzy Star.

            On May 26, 2015, the band announced their fifth album Depression Cherry. It was released on August 28 via Sub Pop (on Bella Union in the UK) and the band announced a world tour in support. Talking about the direction of the new album, the band said, "In general, this record shows a return to simplicity, with songs structured around a melody and a few instruments, with live drums playing a far lesser role. With the growing success of Teen Dream and Bloom, the larger stages and bigger rooms naturally drove us towards a louder, more aggressive place; a place farther from our natural tendencies. Here, we continue to let ourselves evolve while fully ignoring the commercial context in which we exist." "I think, this album continues to change meaning for me. But if anything, it's full of many things. Love, pain, getting older, dealing with loss, letting go. It's really ultimately whatever the listener feels in response to it," has Legrand described. "The name Depression Cherry is like a dance between these two energies. That very abstract feeling summed up the energy field of the record for us," specifies Victoria. This LP received praise from critics.
